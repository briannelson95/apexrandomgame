Random Load-Out Generator for Apex Legends

Idea Inspiration:

I was inspired to create this application after watching some streamers playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Warzone. I looked into the creator's (UJGA) GitHub. I'm very new to javascript coding but had enough knowledge to read through and understand what his code was doing. I started writing my own scripts and referencing their code.

How it Works:

In it's current state, upon clicking the "Generate Loadout" button, the script will choose a random number rounded down which is linked to the weaponsArray. I've added weights to the weapons, all of the floor loot weapons the same weight and individual weights for the air drop "heirloom" weapons. This was decided on as there's a slim chance that you'll come across an air drop that has the weapon assigned to you, so I wanted these weapons to show up less often in the generation. 

The same thing happens with the Legends except they all contain the same weight. I added the "Reroll Legend" button in case you come across a generation which you don't have that legend currently unlocked. Use the Legend as you wish, it's not completely necessary but adds a fun challege. 

Intended Play:

The intended way to play is to generate a loadout (and/or) legend. As you drop into a match of APEX Legends, you can use any weapons you find until you are able to use the loadout that was generated.

My friends and I tried an alternate way to play, in which we were not allowed to use any other weapons than those that were generated. This means we could only fight with our fists, as you can imagine this was fairly difficult and in my opinion, made the challene not fun at all. So take that for what it is and choose how you wish to play.
